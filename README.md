Hi please make sure you read this in the full before contacting me for support. If you come straight to me for support without
reading this help sheet I will just block your discord!

**NOTE I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BANS TO YOUR ACCOUNTS! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

You will also need to be an admin of a server to invite this bot. 

### NODE Step 1
1: Make sure you have node.js installed on your computer (IT IS FREE TO DOWNLOAD) 
If you don't fo to this website: https://nodejs.org

### Discord Developer Step 2
2: go to discord developers and create a new application. Name it whatever you like.

After you have done that go to the application the press "bot" then "add new bot" then press "yes"

from there you should see a title called "Click to reveal token" press it then copy the token.

With the token you have just copied go to the "nuke.js" file and at the bottom where it says "nuke.login("YOUR BOT TOKEN")" paste your token


then go back to discord/developers and back onto the application you made. and press "0Auth2" and then select "BOT" in the scopes

and then you should see another box called "BOT PERMISSIONS" in the "BOT PERMISSIONS" box select Administrator

then copy the link that should look like this: 


https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=585118734301151240&permissions=0&scope=bot


add the bot to the server you want to nuke.

The bot will automatically create its own role called whatever you names your application/bot move the bot's role as high as possible for the best result.
